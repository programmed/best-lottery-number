===================

Grab lottery numbers from official websites and calculate common occurrences

Sets the day of the month and compares it to the last update.

If current day is higher then last updated day it will grab the lotto numbers from the website and save to csv file.

The html tags are stripped and it is comma delimiter

If it is your first time using the script then change the variable in the file last_updated.php to a number less than the current day of the month and open in localhost. It will update the lotto.csv file 100% so you do not need to download .csv file. I just added it here for an example.

I think this would make a great "R" project
